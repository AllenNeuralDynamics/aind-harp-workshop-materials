# Logging

## Logging messages from device

- Subscribe to `BehaviorEvents`
- Add a `GroupBy(Bonsai.Harp)` operator
- Add a `MessageWriter` operator. Set the `FileName` property to `MyDevice.harp/Behavior.bin`

## Ask for a device register read-dump

It is critical that the messages logged from the device are sufficient to reconstruct its state history. For that to be true, we need to know the initial state of all registers. This can be asked via a special register in the protocol core: [`OperationControl`](https://harp-tech.org/protocol/Device.html#r_operation_ctrl-u16--operation-mode-configuration). This register has a single bit that, when set, will trigger the device to send a dump all the values of all its registers.

- To the previous example, in a different branch:
- Add a `Timer` operator with its `DueTime` property set to 2 seconds. This will mimic the delayed start of an experiment.
- Add a `CreateMessage(Bonsai.Harp)` operator after the `Timer`
- Select `OperationControlPayload` under `Payload`. Depending on your use case, you might want to change some of the settings, but we recommend:
  - `DumpRegisters` set to `True` (Required for the dump)
  - `Heartbeat` set to `True` (Useful to know the device is still alive)
  - `MuteReplies` set to `False`
  - `OperationLed` set to `True`
  - `OperationMode` set to `Active`
  - `VisualIndicator` set to `On`
- Add a `Multicast` operator to send the message to the device

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In your experiments, always validate that your logging routine has fully initialized before requesting a reading dump from the device. Failure to do so may result in missing data.

## Completing the logging pattern with the `device.yml` configuration file

In order to use [`harp-python`](https://harp-tech.org/articles/python.html) data interface to its full extent, we need to provide a `device.yml` configuration file. This file will contain the device's register map, which is necessary to interpret the data logged from the device.

This file can be manually added to the root of the logged data folder, or it can be saved in Bonsai:
- To the previous examples, in a different branch:
- Add a `DeviceMetadata(Harp.Behavior)` operator
- Add a `WriteAllText` operator to save the metadata to a file named `device.yml`

All the previous patterns come together in the following workflow:

Stay tuned for updates as, while the logging spec has been defined, the `Bonsai.Harp` library will soon be updated to include operators to more easily implement these patterns!
