# Parsing AnalogData `Event` messages

In a previous exampled we mentioned referred to `AnalogData` as a high-frequency event that carries the ADC readings. It is important to note that, as opposed to `FirmwareVersionHigh` which belongs to the core registers common across all Harp devices, `AnalogData` is a Harp Behavior specific register. As result, we must use the `Harp.Behavior` package to parse this register:

- Subscribe to the `BehaviorEvents` stream.
- Add a `Parse(Harp.Behavior)` operator
- Set `Register` to `AnalogData`
- The output type of `Parse` will now change to a structure with the fields packed in this register.
- To select the data from channel 0, right-click on the `Parse` operator and select `AnalogInput0`.
- Run Bonsai and check the output of the `AnalogInput0` stream.

You will notice that despite the timestamp being present in the message, the `AnalogInput0` output stream is not timestamped. This is because the `Parse` operator does not propagate the timestamp from the original message by default. In cases where the timestamp is necessary, for each `<Payload>` we have a corresponding `Timestamped<Payload>` that can be selected in all `Parse` operators. This will add an extra field to the parsed structure, `Seconds`, that contains the timestamp of the original message (in seconds):

- Modify the `Register` property to `TimestampedAnalogData`
- Select the `AnalogInput0` and `Seconds` members from the output structure.
- Optionally pair the elements into a `Tuple` using the `Zip` operator.
